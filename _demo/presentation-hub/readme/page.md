## Create, Publish, and Share Markdown-based Slides with Grav Presentation Hub!

1. Create a new [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository (hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or your own server) with at least one commit.
2. Tap the 'Setup Git Sync' link on the far right of the site navigation bar of this page for step-by-step instructions.
3. Go to the Git Sync Link options in the [Admin Active Theme panel](../../admin/themes/mytheme) to change the display and functionality of the automatically displayed Git Sync Link (including not displaying it).

## Extend the Capabilities of Your Learning Management System (LMS)  

By adding the URL parameter (i.e. flag) `chromeless:true` to any Open Matter Presentation Hub page you can display that page's content without the global header image, site navigation bar, sidebar and footer - a great way to seamlessly embed Open Matter Presentation Hub pages into other systems.  

For example, the URL [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-matter-presentation-hub-site/](https://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-matter-presentation-hub-site/) displays the standard Open Matter Presentation Hub list page but the URL [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-matter-presentation-hub-site/chromeless:true](https://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-matter-presentation-hub-site/chromeless:true) will only display that page's content. Any links between Open Matter Presentation Hub pages will result in pages being displayed in the same manner.

## What More can the Presentation Plugin Do?
The [Presentation Plugin](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation) by [Ole Vik](https://olevik.me) brings the power of the [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) presentation framework to [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/). You can learn more on the [Presentation Plugin ReadMe](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation/blob/master/README.md).
