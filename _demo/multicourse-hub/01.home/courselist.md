## Welcome!

This is the homepage for your new  **Grav MultiCourse Hub** that supports **multiple courses** within a single Grav install. To display correctly, the `MultiCourse Hub` option in the Active Theme must be `enabled`.

Each course can have its own header image, sidebar and footer - and these items can also be shared across all courses. Using the [Page Inject Plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-page-inject), content can also be shared between one or more courses.

Want to learn more? Visit the multicourse hub documentation at [learn.hibbittsdesign.org](https://learn.hibbittsdesign.org/opencoursehub/multicourse-hubs).
